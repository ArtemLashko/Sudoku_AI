<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<p>Built a board recognition feature with OpenCV and developed a graph theory algorithm to remove noise on the picture.</p>
<p>Trained a convolutional neural network to recognize a number in a cell with 99.02 % accuracy.</p>
<p>Developed a Sudoku solver in C++ with an approach based on consistency check and backtrack search(AC-3), resulting in a 10x increase in performance as opposed to a python solution.</p>

## Preprocessing and cropping
<div>
<img src = "images/1.jpeg" style="max-width: 100%">
<img src = "images/2.jpg" style="max-width: 100%">
<p>First step: the program takes a picture of a board and uses Gaussian Blur, adaptive thresholding, and dilation. </p>
<img src = "images/3.jpg" style="max-width: 100%">
<p>Second step: It finds the largest polygon from the prepared image and crops it out of the original image.</p>
<img src = "images/4.jpg" style="max-width: 100%">
<p>Third step: Since our ML model is taught on grayscale images, we need to change
our image to grayscale.
</p>

<!-- Removing noise in the picture -->
## Removing noise in the picture
<div>
<p>We resize our image to a square 450px x 450px,
and iterate over 50px*50px cells.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>This is our input.</p>
<p>As we can see, it has a lot of noise and unnecessary borders.</p>
<img src = "images/cell2.jpg" style="max-width: 100%">
</li>
  <li><p>What do we know about a cell?</p>
    <p> 1. Some part of a digit should be located somewhere in the center.</p>
    <p> 2. All digits (0-9) are connected graphs ideally.</p>
    <p> So, let's clear our picture. So, let's clear our picture. Colors in the grayscale are in a range from 0 (Black) to 255 (White). 
    <p> We won't have clear black or white colors. So let's say that if a pixel has at least 1/2 of 255, it is white. In practice, it works great.
</p>
    <p> Let's iterate over the center of the picture and dfs on white cells.
</p>
<p> If we are at the white pixel, we should also check pixels nearby (point number 2) and include them.
</p>
<p> All visited cells we add on the new photo, and we have a picture without noise and without any borders (Since we won't go there in a dfs).
</p>
<img src = "images/cell3.jpg" style="max-width: 100%"></li>
  <li>
<p>Final step: center the image.</p>
<img src = "images/cell4.jpg" style="max-width: 100%"></li>
</ul>
